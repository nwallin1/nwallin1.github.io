        <p>I program in multiple different languages. Working as an intern for Binghamton University's ITS, I perform a combination of front and back-end work in a web development environment, 
          creating new and improving existing applications used by Students and Faculty at <span class="BU">Binghamton University</span>

    <div class="card card2">
      <h2 class="subcard-header">I'm a Student.</h2>
      <p>I study Computer Science as part of the Class of 2021 at <span class="BU">Binghamton University.</span>
        The opportunity to study at the #1 Public University in New York has been an unimaginably positive experience on my life.
      Learning from professors who perform the highest level of research in their fields has given me the knowledge I need begin my successful career as a Computer Scientist.
        I have built strong professional and personal relationships at Binghamton University that I hope to carry with me through my future successes. </p>

<!-- My professors are all amazing people many of whom are performing the highest level's of research in the fields that they teach,
            Each of my professors has given me a unique experience that I will take with me for the rest of my life. Whether it be the knowledge they taught me, the interest they gave me in not only my primary field of study, but learning to be a well-rounded individual, the times they reached out to help me understand course content or even teach me non-course content,
            and of course the immense knowledge they gave me in so many aspects of the Computer Science field that has helped shape me into the programmer I am today.
          The community is a conglomeration of domestic and international populations, all bring their own unique personalities and experiences to the community.
        At Binghamton, I met my first friends from downstate New York, my first friends from multiple other 
        States, and my first friends from multiple different countries including South Korea, China, and the United Kingdom. -->
